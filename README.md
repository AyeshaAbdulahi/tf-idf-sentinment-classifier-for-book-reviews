# TF-IDF-SENTIMENT-CLASSIFIER-FOR-BOOK-REVIEWS

<p> 
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using TF-IDF vectorization to classify book reviews as positive or negative. The goal is to gain insights into customer sentiment based on review data. The model uses logistic regression for classification and evaluates performance through metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and log loss.

## Features

<p>
Data Cleaning: Eliminated white spaces, converted text to lowercase, and removed special characters.
</p>

<p>
Feature Extraction: Used TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into meaningful feature vectors.
</p>

<p>
Model: Logistic Regression classifier applied to the transformed feature vectors.
</p>

<p>
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the regularization parameter C to enhance model performance.
</p>

<p>
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and log loss used to assess the modelâ€™s performance.
</p>

## Results

<p>
After applying the model, various metrics were calculated to assess its performance, with hyperparameter tuning improving results.
